## Data Corrections - 2024-2025 Time Standards

The following corrections were applied to clearly inconsistent data\* in the source PDF from the OSI site:

| Age/Gender | Event | Course | Standard | PDF Value | JSON Value | Status | Reason |
|------------|-------|--------|----------|-----------|------------|--------|--------|
| Girls 9 | 100 Breast | LCM | A | `1:96.99` | `1:56.99` | ‚úÖ Corrected | Invalid format |
| Girls 10 | 100 Fly | LCM | B+ | `125:79.19` | `1:54.19` | ‚úÖ Corrected | OCR error |
| Girls 13 | 200 Breast | SCM | B | ~`3:31.89`** | `2:51.89` | ‚ö†Ô∏è Error | B faster than A/B+ |

\* *The OSI PDF may contain errors; and so can this app! Refer directly OSI for questions/corrections.*

\** *This might be the expected value based on time progression for this event, but it's just a guess.*
